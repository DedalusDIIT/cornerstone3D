Here are the breaking changes from the cornerstone 1.x to 2.x.

## Building And Bundling


### Typescript Version


We have upgraded the typescript version from 4.6 to 5.5 in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D.
This upgrade most likely don't require any changes in your codebase, but it is recommended to update the typescript version in your project to 5.5
to avoid any issues in the future.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

The upgrade to TypeScript 5.4 allows us to leverage the latest features and improvements offered by the TypeScript standard. You can read more about it here: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/

</details>

### ECMAScript Target

In Cornerstone3D version 1.x, we targeted ES5. With the release of version 2.0, we have updated our target to `ES2022`.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

It will result in a smaller bundle size and improved performance. There is a good chance that your setup already supports ES2022:

https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/

</details>


### Remove of CJS

Starting with Cornerstone3D 2.x, we will no longer ship the CommonJS (CJS) build of the library. You most likely won't need to make any changes to your codebase. If you are aliasing the cjs library in your bundler, you can remove it completely.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Both Node.js and modern browsers now support ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by default. However, in the rare case where you need a non-ESM version, you can use the Universal Module Definition (UMD) build of the library.
</details>


## DICOM Image Loader

### Decoders Update

`@cornerstonejs/dicomImageLoader` previously utilized the old API for web workers, which is now deprecated. It has transitioned to the new web worker API via the `comlink` package. This change enables more seamless interaction with web workers and facilitates compiling and bundling the web workers to match the ESM version of the library.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

To consolidate the web worker API using a new ES module format, which will enable new bundlers like `vite` to work seamlessly with the library.

</details>


### Removing support for non-worker decoders

We have removed support for non-web worker decoders in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D. This change is to ensure that the library is more performant and to reduce the bundle size.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

We see no compelling reason to use non-worker decoders anymore. Web worker decoders offer superior performance and better compatibility with modern bundlers.

</details>


### DICOM Image Loader ESM default

We have changed the default export of the DICOM Image Loader to ESM in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D and correctly
publish types

This mean you don't need to have an alias for the dicom image loader anymore

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>

Probably in your webpack or other bundler you had this

```js
 alias: {
  '@cornerstonejs/dicom-image-loader':
    '@cornerstonejs/dicom-image-loader/dist/dynamic-import/cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.min.js',
},
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

Now you can remove this alias and use the default import

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

ESM is the future of JavaScript, and we want to ensure that the library is compatible with modern bundlers and tools.

</details>

### InitCornerstoneDICOMImageLoader

We have cleaned up how you initialize the DICOM Image Loader in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>


```js
cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.external.cornerstone = cornerstone;
  cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.external.dicomParser = dicomParser;
  cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.configure({
    useWebWorkers: true,
    decodeConfig: {
      convertFloatPixelDataToInt: false,
      use16BitDataType: preferSizeOverAccuracy || useNorm16Texture,
    },
  });

  let maxWebWorkers = 1;

  if (navigator.hardwareConcurrency) {
    maxWebWorkers = Math.min(navigator.hardwareConcurrency, 7);
  }

  var config = {
    maxWebWorkers,
    startWebWorkersOnDemand: false,
    taskConfiguration: {
      decodeTask: {
        initializeCodecsOnStartup: false,
        strict: false,
      },
    },
  };

  cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.webWorkerManager.initialize(config);
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
let maxWebWorkers = 1;

  if (navigator.hardwareConcurrency) {
    maxWebWorkers = Math.min(navigator.hardwareConcurrency, 7);
  }

  cornerstoneDICOMImageLoader.configure({
    cornerstone,
    dicomParser,
    useWebWorkers: true,
    maxWebWorkers,
    decodeConfig: {
      convertFloatPixelDataToInt: false,
      use16BitDataType: preferSizeOverAccuracy || useNorm16Texture,
    },
  });

```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

Due to circular dependencies in the previous version, we modified the initialization process for the DICOM image loader. This change enhances the library's robustness and simplifies maintenance.

</details>

## Viewport APIs

### Reset Camera

Previously, we had a `resetCamera` method that took positional arguments. Now it takes an object argument.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>


```js
viewport.resetCamera(false, true, false);

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
viewport.resetCamera({
      resetZoom: true,
      resetPan: false,
      resetToCenter: false,
    });
```


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

 This change enhances our future development process by ensuring we won't need to modify the method signature later. It also improves readability for users calling the method.

 <details>


### Viewport Properties

#### Rotation
The `rotation` property has been removed from `getProperties`


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>


```js
viewport.getProperties().rotation
viewport.setProperties({ rotation: 10 });
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
const { rotation } = viewport.getViewPresentation();
viewport.setViewPresentation({ rotation: 10 });

```


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

`rotation` is not a property of the viewport but rather a view prop. You can now access it through `getViewPresentation`.

</details>


### getReferenceId

is now `getViewReferenceId`


```js
getReferenceId --> getViewReferenceId
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
It is more accurate to use `getViewReferenceId` to reflect the actual function of the method.
</details>


## Renaming and Nomenclature



### createAndCacheVolume


```js
createAndCacheVolume  --> createAndCacheEmptyVolume
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
We received numerous inquiries about why volumes weren't loading using `createAndCacheVolume`. The reason was that the actual method name is `createAndCacheEmptyVolume`. To address this confusion, we renamed the method to accurately reflect its function.
</details>

### Segmentation Methods


```js
getColorForSegmentIndex --> getSegmentIndexColor
getSegmentationIdRepresentations --> getRepresentationsBySegmentationId
fillVolumeSegmentationWithMockData --> fillVolumeLabelmapWithMockData
```

:::note
There are more changes in the segmentation methods, which are detailed in the Segmentation section below
:::

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Method renaming and nomenclature changes in version 2.0 of Cornerstone3D aim to enhance consistency and usability. For example, in the segmentation methods, there were numerous discrepancies in naming conventions. Some methods used `get[Property]For[Segmentation/SegmentIndex]`, while others used `get[Segmentation/SegmentIndex][Property]`. We have standardized the format to `get[Property]For[Segmentation/SegmentIndex]` throughout the library. This change improves consistency, autocomplete functionality, and overall readability.

We have clarified in our Polymorphic segmentation that a segmentation is not limited to a labelmap but can also be a contour, surface, or other forms. To reflect this distinction, we are renaming the method `fillVolumeSegmentationWithMockData` to `fillVolumeLabelmapWithMockData`. This change emphasizes that the method is specifically for labelmaps only.
</details>

### Units

In the annotation cachedStats you need to use the new units

```js
unit --> lengthUnits
areaUnit --> areaUnits
modalityUnit --> pixelValueUnits
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
There was too much inconsistency in the units used throughout the library. We had `unit`, `areaUnits`, `modalityUnit`, and various others. Now, we have consolidated these units. You need to update your codebase to reflect the new unit system if you are hydrating annotations for Cornerstone3D.

In addition modalityUnit is now pixelValueUnits to reflect the correct term, since for a single modality there can be multiple pixel values (e.g, PT SUV, PT RAW, PT PROC)

</details>



## Other

### cloneDeep

The `structuredClone` function has replaced the previous method. You don't need to make any changes to your codebase that uses Cornerstone3D.

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Why to depend on a third-party library when we can use the native browser API?

</details>


### Always Prescale

By default, Cornerstone3D always prescales images with the modality LUT. You probably don't need to make any changes to your codebase.


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Previously, the decision to prescale was made by the viewport, and all viewports were doing it. However, we observed prescaling bugs in some custom image loaders that users had implemented. These issues have now been resolved by always prescaling.

</details>


### getDataInTime

The imageCoordinate is renamed to worldCoordinate in the 2.0 version of the cornerstone3D. As it
is the correct term and was misleading in the previous version.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>

```js
const options = {
    imageCoordinate
  };

function getDataInTime(
  dynamicVolume,
  options
):
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
const options = {
    worldCoordinate
  };

function getDataInTime(
  dynamicVolume,
  options
):
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
This is the way

</details>




### STACK_VIEWPORT_NEW_STACK owner

Is not the element not the eventTarget

```js
eventTarget.addEventListener(Events.STACK_VIEWPORT_NEW_STACK, newStackHandler);

// should be now

element.addEventListener(Events.STACK_VIEWPORT_NEW_STACK, newStackHandler);
```



<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

We made this change to maintain consistency, as all other events like VOLUME_NEW image were occurring on the element. This modification makes more sense because when the viewport has a new stack, it should trigger an event on the viewport element itself.
</details>




### triggerAnnotationRenderForViewportIds

Now only requires viewportIds and doesn't need renderingEngine anymore

```js
triggerAnnotationRenderForViewportIds(renderingEngine, viewportIds) ---> triggerAnnotationRenderForViewportIds(viewportIds)
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>
Since there is one rendering engine per viewport, there is no need to pass the rendering engine as an argument.
</details>




## referenceId a property on actor is now referencedId

Previously vs now

## TriggerAnnotationRenderForViewportIds

now only needs viewportIds and don'e need renderingEngineUID anymore

## VOLUME_SCROLL_OUT_OF_BOUNDS is VOLUME_VIEWPORT_SCROLL_OUT_OF_BOUNDS



## New Segmentation Model


### No need to add SegmentationDisplayTool

Before

```js
toolGroup2.addTool(SegmentationDisplayTool.toolName);

toolGroup1.setToolEnabled(SegmentationDisplayTool.toolName);
```

Now

```js
// nothing
```

<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

We have eliminated the unnecessary connection between the toolGroup and segmentation display. The segmentation display now automatically appears in the viewport when you add a segmentation representation to it.

</details>

----


### Viewport-based Representations


Make it clear that now they need to have separate calls for each viewport

Also we add representations to the viewpots and not toolGroups

removeSegmentationsFromToolGroup is now removeRepresentationsFromViewport






Because of this change, we have updated the method names to reflect the new nomenclature.

Many `getActiveSegmentationRepresentation` and other `get[]SegmentationRepresentation` methods were always accessed through `segmentation.getSegmentationRepresentation`. This was essentially redundant. We have moved away from `[get/add]ActiveSegmentationRepresentation` to `[get/add]Representation`.
Also get/set methods were acting on toolGroupIds, which was not the correct way to do it. We have changed it to act on viewportId (more on this later down)



```js
getActiveSegmentationRepresentation(toolGroupId) --> getActiveRepresentation(viewportId)
setActiveSegmentationRepresentation(toolGroupId, representationUID) --> setActiveRepresentation(viewportId, representationUID)
removeSegmentationsFromToolGroup(toolGroupId, [representationUIDs]) ---> removeRepresentationsFromViewport(viewportId, [representationUIDs])
addSegmentationRepresentations(toolGroupId, representationsArray) --> addRepresentations(viewportId, representtationsArray)
```

Other renaming

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>

```js
getSegmentationIdRepresentations(segmentationId)

```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
getRepresentationsBySegmentationId(segmentationId)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Visibility

Since we are now adding representations to the viewports, we have changed the visibility methods to reflect this change

```js
visibility.setSegmentationVisibility --> visibility.setRepresentationVisibility
```


setSegmentVisibility ---> setSEgmentIndexVisibility


setToolGroupSpecificConfig --> setAllSegmentsConfig


--------


### Stack Labelmaps

To create a Stack Labelmap, you no longer need to manually create a reference between labelmap imageIds and viewport imageIds. We now handle this process automatically for you.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Before" label="Before" default>

```js
segmentation.addSegmentations([
    {
      segmentationId,
      representation: {
        type: csToolsEnums.SegmentationRepresentations.Labelmap,
        data: {
          imageIdReferenceMap:
            cornerstoneTools.utilities.segmentation.createImageIdReferenceMap(
              imageIds,
              segmentationImageIds
            ),
        },
      },
    },
  ]);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="After" label="After">

```js
segmentation.addSegmentations([
    {
      segmentationId,
      representation: {
        type: csToolsEnums.SegmentationRepresentations.Labelmap,
        data: {
          imageIds: segmentationImageIds,
        },
      },
    },
  ]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


<details>
<summary>Why?</summary>

This is a long Why ...

The previous model required users to provide an imageIdReferenceMap, which linked labelmap imageIds to viewport imageIds. This approach presented several challenges when implementing advanced segmentation use cases:

1. Manual creation of the map was error-prone, particularly regarding the order of imageIds.

2. Once a segmentation was associated with specific viewport imageIds, rendering it elsewhere became problematic. For example:

   a. Rendering a CT image stack segmentation on a single key image.
   b. Rendering a CT image stack segmentation on a stack that includes both CT and other images.
   c. Rendering a DX dual energy segmentation from energy 1 on energy 2.
   d. Rendering a CT labelmap from a stack viewport on a PT labelmap in the same space.

These scenarios highlight the limitations of the previous model.

We've now transitioned to a system where users only need to provide imageIds. During rendering, we match the viewport's current imageId against the labelmap imageIds and render the segmentation if there's a match. This matching process occurs in the SegmentationStateManager, with the criterion being that the segmentation must be in the same plane as the referenced viewport.

This new approach enables numerous additional use cases and offers greater flexibility in segmentation rendering.
